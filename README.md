## Student Demographics & Academic Performance Dashboard

### 📌 Context
This dashboard was created as part of my Power BI training homework.  
The task was to design a report that would help us become more familiar with the different visualization options available in Power BI.  
The goal wasn’t just to display data, but to experiment with charts, tables, and filters to understand how each visualization can highlight insights in different ways.

### 🎯 Objective
To explore how Power BI visualizations can be applied to educational data, specifically focusing on:
- Student demographics
- Academic performance
- Enrollment status
- Financial insights

### 🔑 Key Features
- 📊 **Demographics:** Gender distribution and student counts by department and year level  
- 🎓 **Academic Performance:** Average GPA by department and GPA distribution ranges  
- 📝 **Enrollment Status:** Breakdown of students by enrollment categories (enrolled, on leave, graduated, dropped)  
- 💰 **Financial Insights:** Tuition fee totals by department and scholarship type  
- 👥 **Engagement:** Student counts by adviser and scholarship type, showing how support structures vary across departments  

### 🧩 Learning Outcomes
- Practiced using different visualization types (bar charts, pie charts, tables, KPI cards)  
- Learned how to apply filters and slicers to make the dashboard interactive  
- Understood the importance of data cleaning and structuring before visualization  
- Gained confidence in designing dashboards that balance clarity, readability, and storytelling  

### 💭 Reflection
This exercise helped me see how Power BI can transform raw student data into meaningful insights.  
By experimenting with multiple visualization types, I learned how to choose the right chart for the right story.  
It also reinforced the importance of layout and design — making sure the dashboard feels approachable and easy to navigate.

## 🌍 Global Renewable Electricity Production Dashboard

### 📌 Context
This dashboard was created as part of my Power BI training homework, where I practiced importing and cleaning data from external sources. I used Wikipedia tables on electricity production by source and country, transforming them into a structured dataset for visualization.

### 🎯 Objective
To explore how Power BI can visualize global energy trends, highlighting the role of different renewable sources and comparing production across countries.

### 🔑 Key Features
•	☀️ Energy Sources: Breakdown of electricity production by biomass, solar, wind, and hydro.
•	🌎 Country Comparison: Top producers by renewable source, showing regional strengths.
•	📈 Trend Analysis: Relative contribution of each source to total renewable generation.
•	🔍 Interactive Filters: Ability to drill down by country or energy type.

### 🧩 Learning Outcomes
•	Practiced data cleaning and transformation from webscraped tables.
•	Learned how to design dashboards for global comparison and benchmarking.
•	Strengthened skills in visual storytelling with sustainability data.

### 💭 Reflection
This project showed me how Power BI can make complex global datasets approachable. By visualizing renewable energy production, I gained insight into how different regions contribute to the clean energy transition and how dashboards can support sustainability discussions.

## 🏢 Retail Store Performance Dashboard

### 📌 Context
This dashboard was another Power BI training homework, designed to help us experiment with mapping, customer behavior analysis, and financial metrics. The dataset focused on retail stores in Colorado, tracking visits and spending patterns.

### 🎯 Objective
To analyze customer engagement and spending across multiple retail locations, identifying trends that could inform store strategy and resource allocation.

### 🔑 Key Features
•	🗺️ Store Mapping: Geographic visualization of retail locations in Colorado.
•	👥 Customer Visits: Number of visits per store, highlighting high traffic areas.
•	💳 Spend Analysis: Average spend per customer and total revenue by store.
•	📊 Comparisons: Side by side view of visits vs. spend to identify performance gaps.

### 🧩 Learning Outcomes
•	Practiced using map visualizations in Power BI.
•	Learned how to combine financial and behavioral metrics in one dashboard.
•	Strengthened ability to design dashboards that support business decision making.

### 💭 Reflection
This exercise helped me see how Power BI can connect location data with customer behavior, making retail insights more actionable. It reinforced the importance of combining multiple perspectives — geography, visits, and spend — to tell a complete performance story.
