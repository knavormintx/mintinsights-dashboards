# Student Demographics & Academic Performance Dashboard

## 📌 Context
This dashboard was created as part of my Power BI training homework.  
The task was to design a report that would help us become more familiar with the different visualization options available in Power BI.  
The goal wasn’t just to display data, but to experiment with charts, tables, and filters to understand how each visualization can highlight insights in different ways.

## 🎯 Objective
To explore how Power BI visualizations can be applied to educational data, specifically focusing on:
- Student demographics
- Academic performance
- Enrollment status
- Financial insights

## 🔑 Key Features
- 📊 **Demographics:** Gender distribution and student counts by department and year level  
- 🎓 **Academic Performance:** Average GPA by department and GPA distribution ranges  
- 📝 **Enrollment Status:** Breakdown of students by enrollment categories (enrolled, on leave, graduated, dropped)  
- 💰 **Financial Insights:** Tuition fee totals by department and scholarship type  
- 👥 **Engagement:** Student counts by adviser and scholarship type, showing how support structures vary across departments  

## 🧩 Learning Outcomes
- Practiced using different visualization types (bar charts, pie charts, tables, KPI cards)  
- Learned how to apply filters and slicers to make the dashboard interactive  
- Understood the importance of data cleaning and structuring before visualization  
- Gained confidence in designing dashboards that balance clarity, readability, and storytelling  

## 💭 Reflection
This exercise helped me see how Power BI can transform raw student data into meaningful insights.  
By experimenting with multiple visualization types, I learned how to choose the right chart for the right story.  
It also reinforced the importance of layout and design — making sure the dashboard feels approachable and easy to navigate.
